# [React Bangalore Meetup #14](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Bangalore/events/278654306/?_xtd=gqFyqTI2NjU3MDgwNqFwp2FuZHJvaWQ&from=ref) 

In this talk, the primary focus was around how to build developer products such as libraries, open source projects, tools etc. Made an effort to explore and explain the process of developing a library (here, React Component Library) by understanding how it is done in popular open source projects and else where. Also, throughout the talk, along with tech explanation, there was a lot of live-code and eventually we publish our own **React Component Library** to NPM!

This repository contains the code used to demonstrate during the talk. I hope you find it useful :)
